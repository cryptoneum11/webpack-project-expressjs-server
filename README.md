A minimal configuration for webpack front-end development with ExpressJS backend for routing requests

- Pug template configured
- Sass configured
- Express backend
- MongoDB integration


How it works

- /client outputs the /dist output content into /server/dist
- server.js starts up a server via express
- we are able to view the /dist content folder by using a static directory in the express code
